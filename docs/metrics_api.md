# Backend API Documentation

The backend API uses GraphQL. There is one endpoint, `/api/graphql`, that accepts a query string containing the necessary parameters for the query and the fields to be returned in the response.

The GraphQL API is available publicly at https://muni.opentransit.city/api/graphql . (In a development environment, the URL is http://localhost:5000/api/graphql .) This endpoint can be called via either GET or POST. When making a GET request, the GraphQL query should be passed as a URL-encoded parameter named `query`. Variables may optionally be passed as a URL-encoded JSON-encoded object in a parameter named `variables`.

For example, the following GraphQL query would return some statistics about headways and wait times for a particular stop on one day:

```
query($agencyId: String!, $routeId:String!, $startStopId:String!, $date:String) {
  routeMetrics(agencyId:$agencyId, routeId:$routeId) {
    trip(startStopId:$startStopId) {
      interval(dates:[$date]) {
        headways { median max }
        waitTimes { median }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To run the above query with the variables `$routeId` = "1", `$startStopId` = "16307", and `$date` = "2019-12-10", you can make a GET request to the URL below:

http://muni.opentransit.city/api/graphql?query=query(%24agencyId%3AString!%2C+%24routeId%3AString!%2C+%24startStopId%3AString!%2C+%24date%3AString)+%7B+routeMetrics(agencyId%3A%24agencyId%2C+routeId%3A%24routeId)+%7B+trip(startStopId%3A%24startStopId)+%7B+interval(dates%3A%5B%24date%5D)+%7B+headways+%7B+median+max+%7D+waitTimes+%7B+median+%7D+%7D+%7D+%7D+%7D&variables=%7B"agencyId":"muni","routeId":"1","startStopId":"16307","date":"2019-12-10"%7D

Queries can also be sent via POST, with the Content-Type `application/json`, and a request body like this:

```
{
  "query": "...",
  "variables": { "myVariable": "someValue", ... }
}
```

# Structure of a GraphQL Query

OpenTransit's data is organized as a nested structure of objects. Each object represents a subset of the data (data about a route, data about a stop, data about bus arrivals, etc). This data is divided into fields, which are either other objects or primitive types (the relevant primitive types for this API are `String`, `Int` and `Float`). For instance, to fetch information about every route, we would start by querying `routes`, which returns a `[RouteInfo]`, a list of routes.

RouteInfo has the following properties:
```
id: String
title: String
config: RouteConfig
```

The structure of a GraphQL query reflects this nested structure - in a query, the client must specify which fields it wants the server to return in the response. Nested fields are contained in nested brackets - for instance, the query:

```graphql
query {
  routes(agencyId:"muni") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

returns only the `id` and `title` of every route, but not the `config` property:

```
{
  "data": {
    "routes": [
      {
        "id": "E",
        "title": "E-Embarcadero"
      },
      {
        "id": "F",
        "title": "F-Market & Wharves"
      },
      {
        "id": "J",
        "title": "J-Church"
      },
      ...
```

Note that all the innermost elements of the query have to be primitive types. Since RouteConfig is not a primitive type, the query

```graphql
query {
  routes(agencyId:"muni") {
    id
    title
    config
  }
}
```

will return an error. This query **doesn't** work because it isn't requesting any fields from `config` that are primitive types. But the query

```graphql
query {
  routes(agencyId:"muni") {
    id
    title
    config {
      stops { id title lat lon }
      directions { id stopIds }
    }
  }
}
```

**does** work, since `title`, `lat`, `lon`, `stopIds`, etc. are all primitive types:

```
{
  "data": {
    "routes": [
      {
        "id": "E",
        "title": "E-Embarcadero",
        "config": {
          "stops": [
            {
              "id": "15184",
              "title": "Jones St & Beach St",
              "lat": 37.80713,
              "lon": -122.41732
            },
            {
              "id": "13092",
              "title": "Beach St & Mason St",
              "lat": 37.80741,
              "lon": -122.41412
            },
            {
              "id": "13095",
              "title": "Beach St & Stockton St",
              "lat": 37.80784,
              "lon": -122.41081
            },
            ...
```

### Parameters in Queries

Querying information about a particular route or stop requires input parameters. For instance, to fetch the summary statistics for wait times at stop `14015` on route `1` on the date `2019-12-11`, the query would need to pass in `routeId`, `startStopId` and `dates` parameters:

```graphql
query {
  routeMetrics(agencyId:"muni",routeId:"1") {
    trip(startStopId:"14015") {
      interval(dates:["2019-12-11"]) {
        waitTimes {
          avg median max
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query returns the following response:

```
{
  "data": {
    "routeMetrics": {
      "trip": {
        "interval": {
          "waitTimes": {
            "avg": 4.819,
            "median": 3.194,
            "max": 28.417
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A list of parameters for the `routeConfig` and `routeMetrics` fields is given [below](#query).

    }
  }
}
```

### Returning statistics for multiple sets of parameters in a single query

You can create aliases of any property in order to return data e.g. multiple pairs of stops, multiple date ranges in a single GraphQL query. You can also create reusable fragments to reduce duplication in queries:

```graphql
fragment intervalFields on IntervalMetrics {
   waitTimes { median }
}
query {
  routeMetrics(agencyId:"muni", routeId:"1") {
    trip1: trip(startStopId:"14015", endStopId:"16304") {
      allDay: interval(dates:["2019-12-11"]) {
        ...intervalFields
      }
      morning: interval(dates:["2019-12-11"], startTime:"06:00", endTime:"10:00") {
        ...intervalFields
      }
    }
    trip2: trip(startStopId:"16307", endStopId:"16311") {
      allDay: interval(dates:["2019-12-11"]) {
        ...intervalFields
      }
      morning: interval(dates:["2019-12-11"], startTime:"06:00", endTime:"10:00") {
        ...intervalFields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```
{
  "data": {
    "routeMetrics": {
      "trip1": {
        "allDay": {
          "waitTimes": {
            "median": 3.194
          }
        },
        "morning": {
          "waitTimes": {
            "median": 2.763
          }
        }
      },
      "trip2": {
        "allDay": {
          "waitTimes": {
            "median": 3.641
          }
        },
        "morning": {
          "waitTimes": {

          }

# Structure of the Backend API

Complex objects contain fields that are themselves complex objects or are primitive types (`String`, `Int` or `Float`). `String!` denotes a required parameter field, and `[String]` denotes a list of `String` objects.

### WaitTimeStats

Contains statistics about wait times at a stop within one or more intervals.
For each interval, these statistics are computed assuming that a rider has an equal probability of arriving at the stop any time in that interval,
but not before the first departure of the day or after the last departure of the day.
If statistics are computed over multiple intervals, each interval will be weighted equally (not weighted by the length of the interval).
These statistics assume that the rider arrives at the stop at a "random" time without using schedules or predictions.
